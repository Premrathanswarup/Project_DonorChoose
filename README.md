# Project_DonorChoose
This project is for DonorsChoose.org.
This is platform dedicated to funding classroom projects, faces significant challenges in efficiently and consistently vetting an increasing number of project proposals. With an anticipated influx of close to 500,000 proposals next year, the organization needs to address the following key issues.

we have two data sets.

we have all data about teachers ID, states, project essay, and revenue and approval rates.

By this data I need to check in which country more profit is there and for which project more revenue/profit is there.

Expected Volume:

1.The platform anticipates receiving close to 500,000 proposals next year. This expectation sets the stage for the urgency in addressing the mentioned challenges. The large number of proposals means that the existing processes might become overwhelmed if they are not adapted or improved to handle the increased load.

To effectively manage this influx, the organization needs to focus on several key areas:

1.Automation: Implementing automated systems for preliminary vetting can help manage the large volume of proposals. Machine learning models can be trained to filter out proposals that do not meet basic criteria, allowing human reviewers to focus on the more promising ones.
2.Resource Allocation: Allocating more resources, such as hiring additional staff or using external reviewers, can help distribute the workload and reduce bottlenecks in the vetting process.
Process Optimization: Streamlining the proposal submission and review process to reduce unnecessary steps and improve turnaround times.
3.Data-Driven Decisions: Utilizing data analytics to identify patterns and insights from past proposals can help in refining the vetting criteria and making more informed decisions.
4.Training and Standards: Ensuring that all reviewers are well-trained and adhere to standardized evaluation criteria to maintain consistency.

Significant Challenges:
The platform faces major difficulties in handling the review and approval process for project proposals. These challenges can stem from several factors:

1.Scalability: As the number of proposals increases, the platform must scale its operations to handle the volume without compromising on the quality and speed of the vetting process.
2.Consistency: Ensuring that each proposal is evaluated fairly and consistently is crucial. Inconsistent vetting can lead to bias, missed opportunities, or funding for less impactful projects.
3.Efficiency: The process must be streamlined to avoid delays. Efficient vetting means that worthy projects receive funding quickly, which is crucial for time-sensitive educational needs.
